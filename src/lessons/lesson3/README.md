# Lesson3

Break it.
Wrap it all up in an ErrorBoundary.

## CHALLENGE

- Break the fetch request by pointing it to a non-existent URL
- Follow the link in the resulting error to React's docs on the `ErrorBoundary` component
- Copy/paste the `ErrorBoundary` component into your app â€” taking care to replace error logging with local logging like `console.log`
- Allow use of a `fallback` prop like `React.Suspense`

---

// CHALLENGE:

// break the api call
// read the resulting error
// copy the error boundary
// change logging to console.log
// show off what it does
// customize ErrorBoundary with fallback, for parity with suspense
// use defaultProps to do i
